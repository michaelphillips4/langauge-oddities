        ELIZA is an early natural language processing computer program created
        from 1964 to 1966 at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by
        Joseph Weizenbaum. Created to demonstrate the superficiality of
        communication between humans and machines, Eliza simulated conversation
        by using a "pattern matching" and substitution methodology that gave
        users an illusion of understanding on the part of the program, but had
        no built in framework for contextualizing events. ELIZA's creator,
        Weizenbaum, regarded the program as a method to show the superficiality
        of communication between man and machine, but was surprised by the
        number of individuals who attributed human-like feelings to the computer
        program, including Weizenbaum's secretary. Many academics believed that
        the program would be able to positively influence the lives of many
        people, particularly those with psychological issues, and that it could
        aid doctors working on such patients' treatment.
